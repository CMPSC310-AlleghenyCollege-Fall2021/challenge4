# Challenge Problem 4

## Deadline: November 1, 2021

Note: While high-level discussion is allowed and encouraged for the challenge problems, these problems should be completed and submitted individually.

### Part 1

Calculate the feedforward output of the neural network that has three inputs, two neurons in the hidden layer, and uses ReLU activation function (`y = max(0, x)`)

[!Simple neural network](https://github.com/CMPSC310-AlleghenyCollege-Fall2021/challenge4/blob/main/nn.png)

```
          [1 2 1]
weights = [0 1 0]
          [2 3 4]

          
          [2 5]
input =   [6 7]
          [1 8]
```

### Part 2

This part of the challenge problem refers to the [Text Generation Example](https://www.tensorflow.org/text/tutorials/text_generation) walkthrough on Google Colab .

1. In a few sentences describe the layers that constitute the model. What is their purpose and input/output of each layer.

2. How can the output be improved?
